# 4x10 Workday Policy - Engineering Team

## Overview

This policy establishes a 4-day, 10-hour workweek schedule for our 6-person engineering team, designed to improve work-life balance while maintaining operational coverage and team collaboration.

## Core Schedule Requirements

### Standard Work Schedule

- **Work Days**: 4 days per week, 10 hours per day (40 hours total)
- **Required Day**: Tuesday (all team members must work)
- **Flexible Days**: Choose 3 additional days from Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
- **Core Hours**: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM (with 1-hour lunch break)

### Tuesday Requirement

- **Rationale**: Ensures full team overlap for sprint planning, customer meetings, and all other mandatory team activities
- **Meeting Day**: Sprint planning, customer meetings, weekly team meetings, and cross-team coordination all occur on Tuesdays
- **No Exceptions**: All team members must be present unless on approved leave

## Day-Off Selection Method

### Rotating Day-Off System

**Process:**

1. Create rotating schedule where day-off assignments change every 2 weeks
2. Ensure fair distribution over time (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday)
3. Account for business needs and project deadlines

**Advantages:**

- Equal opportunity for preferred days off for all team members
- Prevents permanent "Monday blues" or "Friday favorites"
- Everyone experiences different schedule patterns
- More equitable across all seniority levels

## On-Call Override Policy

### On-Call Schedule

- **Rotation**: 1 engineer per week
- **Duration**: 7 consecutive days (Monday-Sunday)
- **Rotation Order**: Alphabetical or by seniority agreement

### On-Call Work Requirements

- **Schedule**: Must work 5 days × 8 hours (40 hours total)
- **Required Days**: Monday through Friday
- **Availability**: Must be reachable during off-hours for critical issues
- **Compensation**: On-call differential pay or comp time (per company policy)

### On-Call Week Procedures

1. **Advance Notice**: 2 weeks minimum notification
2. **Handoff**: Detailed briefing from previous on-call engineer
3. **Documentation**: Maintain incident log and resolution notes
4. **Escalation**: Clear escalation path for critical issues

## Coverage Matrix

| Day | Regular Coverage | On-Call Week Coverage |
|-----|------------------|----------------------|
| Monday | 5 engineers | 6 engineers (including on-call) |
| Tuesday | 6 engineers | 6 engineers (including on-call) |
| Wednesday | 5 engineers | 6 engineers (including on-call) |
| Thursday | 5 engineers | 6 engineers (including on-call) |
| Friday | 5 engineers | 6 engineers (including on-call) |

## Implementation Guidelines

### Initial Setup

1. **Team Meeting**: Discuss policy and gather feedback
2. **Selection Process**: Execute chosen day-off selection method
3. **Schedule Creation**: Develop master schedule with all assignments
4. **Tool Setup**: Update calendars, project management tools, and communication platforms

### Communication Requirements

- **Slack/Teams Status**: Update availability and working hours
- **Calendar Blocking**: Block non-working days as "unavailable"
- **Email Signatures**: Include working days and hours
- **Project Planning**: Factor in team member availability

### Flexibility Provisions

- **Temporary Adjustments**: Allow day swaps for project needs or personal circumstances
- **Approval Process**: Manager approval required for schedule changes
- **Notice Period**: 1 week minimum for non-emergency schedule changes
- **PTO Integration**: PTO days reduce weekly work requirement by 8 hours per day taken
- **Statutory Holidays**: Holiday weeks reduce work requirement by 8 hours (40 to 32 hours)

### PTO and Holiday Guidelines

**PTO Management:**

- Each PTO day reduces weekly requirement by 8 hours
- Engineers maintain their scheduled day off and work reduced hours across remaining days
- PTO on Tuesday (required day) needs manager approval due to missed team meetings
- Multiple PTO days: 2 days = 24 hours required, 3 days = 16 hours required, etc.

**Statutory Holiday Weeks:**

- Work requirement reduces from 40 to 32 hours during holiday weeks
- Engineers maintain their scheduled day off and distribute remaining hours across available days
- Tuesday remains required unless Tuesday is the statutory holiday
- Holiday timing doesn't affect individual fairness - everyone gets same 8-hour reduction

## Monitoring and Adjustment

### Success Metrics

- Team productivity and delivery metrics
- Employee satisfaction surveys
- Meeting attendance and participation rates
- On-call response times and effectiveness
- **Data-driven performance tracking per engineer**

### Data-Driven Performance Tracking

**What We'll Track:**

- **Billable percentage** (must stay ≥76%)
- **Sprint velocity** per engineer
- **Incident response times**
- **Overall operational metrics**
- **"Vibes" metric**: Qualitative assessment from manager and engagement manager

**How We'll Track It:**

- Weekly automated data pulls from Jira, AlertOps/PagerDuty, and time tracking
- **Weekly subjective input** on engineer performance context (blocked, scope changes, external factors)
- Simple dashboard showing green/yellow/red status per engineer with context notes
- Monthly summary reports comparing before/during 4x10

**Decision Framework:**

- Engineers maintain 4x10 privilege if they hit targets OR have strong vibes score with valid context
- **Vibes override**: Good engineer with bad week due to blockers stays green
- **Vibes concern**: Good metrics but poor collaboration/attitude triggers yellow
- Red flags result in return to 5x8 schedule

**Reporting:**

- Weekly internal tracking with context notes
- Monthly reports to leadership including qualitative assessment
- Quarterly comprehensive review of policy success

### Review Schedule

- **Monthly Check-ins**: Informal feedback sessions
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Formal policy assessment
- **Annual Evaluation**: Comprehensive policy review with potential modifications

### Adjustment Triggers

- Significant changes in team size
- Business requirements changes
- Consistent coverage gaps
- Team feedback indicating policy issues

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Incident Response

- On-call engineer is primary responder
- Escalation to additional team members if needed
- All engineers must be reachable during business hours on their working days

### Business Continuity

- Maintain documentation of all systems and processes
- Cross-training requirements for critical systems
- Backup on-call engineer designation

## Policy Approval and Effective Date

**Effective Date**: [Insert Date]
**Review Date**: [Insert Quarterly Review Date]
**Approved By**: [Engineering Manager/Director]
