# Performance Tracking Dashboard Implementation

## Objective
Implement data-driven performance tracking system to monitor 4x10 policy success.

## Requirements from Policy
- Track billable percentage (must stay â‰¥76%)
- Monitor sprint velocity per engineer
- Record incident response times
- Capture "vibes" metric (qualitative assessment)
- Weekly automated data pulls from external systems
- Green/yellow/red status per engineer with context notes
- Monthly summary reports comparing before/during 4x10

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Performance Data Model
- Create performance metrics storage system
- Define data structure for weekly tracking
- Store context notes and qualitative assessments
- Track historical performance trends

### 2. Data Collection System
- Mock integration points for Jira, AlertOps/PagerDuty
- Weekly data collection automation
- Manual input system for "vibes" scores
- Context note capture for performance variations

### 3. Dashboard Interface
- Weekly performance dashboard with traffic light system
- Individual engineer performance cards
- Trend analysis and historical comparisons
- Monthly report generation
- Manager input interface for qualitative assessments

### 4. Decision Framework Logic
- Automated green/yellow/red status calculation
- Vibes override logic (good engineer with bad week stays green)
- Alert system for engineers falling below thresholds
- Recommendation engine for returning to 5x8 schedule

## Files to Create
- `app/models/performance_tracker.py` - Core tracking logic
- `app/views/performance_dashboard.py` - Dashboard interface
- `app/utils/data_collectors.py` - Mock external system integrations
- `data/performance/` - Performance data storage

## Files to Modify
- `app/views/server.py` - Add performance dashboard routes
- `config/team_config.json` - Add performance thresholds

## Success Criteria
- Weekly performance data collection and display
- Traffic light status system for each engineer
- Manager can input qualitative assessments
- Monthly reports show 4x10 policy impact
- Decision framework recommends schedule changes when needed
